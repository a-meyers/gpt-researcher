They will bring about two huge changes: an end to our current infrastructure for cybersecurity over public networks and an explosion of algorithmic power that holds the promise to reshape our world. The Challenges Scientists face myriad challenges in developing commercially relevant quantum computers. But once they are overcome, the disruption caused by postquantum cryptography will eclipse that of Y2K, which cost the United States and its businesses more than $100 billion to mitigate. The Impact This article examines the way quantum computers will not only upend digital security but spur investment, reshape industries, and spark innovation. In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor introduced a quantum-computing algorithm that could reduce the time it takes to find the prime factors of large numbers from billions of years using a conventional transistor-based computer to a few\n",

Quantum Computing: A Looming Threat Quantum computing, though still in its early stages, represents a significant risk to traditional encryption methods. As quantum technology advances, it has the potential to crack encryption standards that are currently considered secure. According to Check Point’s predictions, quantum-resistant cryptography will start gaining traction in 2025 as organizations realize the threat quantum computing poses to data security.

Looking back in 2023 When I wrote The Future of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity a year ago (before the LLM era), I pointed out three unique challenges for AI in cybersecurity: accuracy, data shortage, and lack of ground truth, as well as three common AI challenges but more severe in cybersecurity: explainability, talent scarcity, and AI security. Now, a year later after lots of explorations, we identify LLMs’ big help in four out of these six areas: data shortage, lack of ground truth, explainability, and talent scarcity. The other two areas, accuracy, and AI security, are extremely critical yet still very challenging. I summarize the biggest advantages of using LLMs in cybersecurity in two areas: 1. Data Labeled data Using LLMs has helped us overcome the challenge of not having enough “labeled data”. High-quality labeled data are necessary to make AI models and predictions more accurate and appropriate for cybersecurity use cases. Yet, these data are\n",

In addition, Seyid and Frank (2023) argue that while Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can strengthen threat detection and analysis, security automation and orchestration, and vulnerability management, there are still grey areas that make it exploitable by cybercriminals.Generative AI is designed using deep neural networks, which enable them to analyse vast training datasets and learn the underlying patterns and structures, subsequently generating unique content in different formats (Nvidia 2023). Given that Gen AI tools continue to advance in complexity and capability, Novak and Neil (2023) suggest that their integration into cybersecurity is a double-edged sword with its potential benefits and risks.Considering the above situation, this research paper aims to assess the role of generative AI in cybersecurity, specifically focusing on its opportunities, challenges, and\n",

In fact, I believe there will always be a place for both human and machine intelligence in successful AI deployment because what comes naturally to people, like interpersonal skills and judgment, is difficult for machines — while analyzing mountains of data at scale is nearly impossible for people. Today, many companies leverage some combination of the two. There’s a fine line to walk between leaning on the technology too much and not enough, but getting it right can pay dividends. In a 2018 PwC study, 82% of top-performing companies reported paying close attention to the human experience with digital and tech. As brands across industries aim to do the same, here are four strategies for blending artificial and human intelligence to unlock the full potential of both: Recognize that AI doesn’t work all on its own.

Joanna Pachner: McKinsey has written a lot about cognitive biasesÂ and social dynamics that can skew decision making. Can AI help with these challenges? Yuval Atsmon: When we talk to executives about using AI in strategy development, the first reaction we get is, âThose are really big decisions; what if AI gets them wrong?â The first answer is that humans also get them wrongâa lot. [Amos] Tversky, [Daniel] Kahneman, and others have proven that some of those errors are systemic, observable, and predictable. The first thing AI can do is spot situations likely to give rise to biases. For example, imagine that AI is listening in on a strategy session where the CEO proposes something and everyone says âAyeâ without debate and discussion. AI could inform the room, âWe might have a sunflower bias here,â which could trigger more\n",

In the digital economy era, firms are leveraging digital technologies such as AI to integrate internal and external resources, continuously breaking organizational boundaries [9], thereby creating a more open technological environment for the industrial technology convergence of manufacturing firms.

With the deep integration of information and manufacturing technologies, AI technologies represented by industrial robots are gradually becoming a new driving force for technological transformation, constituting a crucial strategic technological resource [7]. From the perspective of Resource-Based View (RBV), technological resources are pivotal sources of firm innovation [8]. In the digital economy era, firms are leveraging digital technologies such as AI to integrate internal and external resources, continuously breaking organizational boundaries [9], thereby creating a more open technological environment for the industrial technology convergence of manufacturing firms. In this context, we propose, by amalgamating the domains of AI and technology convergence, two important emerging fields of research, the following questions: Can AI act as a catalyst for technology convergence? And what are the specific mechanisms\n",

Such shifts would affect how you deploy talent and executive time, how you spend money and focus sales efforts, and AI can be valuable in guiding that ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/artificial-intelligence-in-strategy)). \n",
